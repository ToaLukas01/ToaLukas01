### Who am I ?
I am a Young Argentine, with a taste for programming and looking to develop professionally in it, current graduate of Henrry's Bootcamp in Full-Stack Developer.

I have aspirations to work outside my country, to be able to travel and see the world.
I aim for tomorrow to dedicate myself fully to the programming and development of video games since I am passionate about that whole area.

I was a student of Information Systems Engineering until the 2nd year of the degree, where I was able to acquire knowledge about Python and systems analysis.

I have experience in sales and customer service since I worked in a shopping business
